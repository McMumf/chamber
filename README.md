# chamber

Kitchen countertop thermal chamber used for longer duration culinary
processes that require precise temperature control such as sourdough
starter care, pickling, and others.

This project was accepted as a demo presentation at the 2019 Hackaday
Superconference! Hackaday wrote a really nice article about the project
too: [Engineering Your Way To Better Sourdough (and Other Fermented Goods)](https://hackaday.com/2020/01/08/engineering-your-way-to-better-sourdough-and-other-fermented-goods/)

## Setup

### Purchasing Materials

BOM: [Chamber BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZfumkMcpwunLCNRvsuWQJhhpWst-3aOSHlbOKffAX_0/edit?usp=sharing)

### Software Requirements

- [ArduiPi_OLED](https://github.com/hallard/ArduiPi_OLED) for interacting with the Arduino OLED
- [pigpio](https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio)

## Roadmap

- Switch controlled interior lights
- Custom PCB to reduce cost and clean up look (maybe a RPi hat!)
- Mechanical design improvements: hinged door, stackable, insulation
